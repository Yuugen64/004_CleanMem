### Built With
* Assembly.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You will have to assemble this into cartridge form, and then find an emulator to run it.



### Prerequisites

This is quite a small bit of code, but:
```sh
1. Using an assembler of your choice, asseble this code into cartridge format so that it can be executed.
2. You will have to find a compatible system or emulator to then run the code.
```

### Installation

1. Click the green download button to get the .zip!



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
- (Recommended) Run in an Atari 2600 emulator.
